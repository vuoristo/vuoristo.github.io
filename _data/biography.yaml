- text: I am a Ph.D. student at <a href="https://whirl.cs.ox.ac.uk/">Whiteson Research Lab</a> at University of Oxford. My research is focused on Meta-Reinforcement Learning (Meta-RL). I'm excited about developing Deep RL into a practical technology and I believe Meta-RL is a good framework for making progress on that.
