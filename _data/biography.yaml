  I am a visiting scholar in Satinder Singh's lab at University of Michigan, working on deep reinforcement learning. I am interested in developing new algorithms for reinforcement learning and applying them to new problems.

  I am joining <a href="https://whirl.cs.ox.ac.uk/">Whiteson Research Lab</a> in fall 2020.
