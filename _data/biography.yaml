  I am a visiting scholar in Satinder Singh's lab at University of Michigan, working on
  deep reinforcement learning and lifelong learning. I am interested in developing
  new algorithms for reinforcement learning and applying them to new problems. Also,
  I am looking for a Ph.D. program for 2020.
